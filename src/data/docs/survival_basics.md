# Absolute Survival Guide (0 knowledge → first 3 hours)

> Goal: teach a *100% blind* player to survive day 1, build shelter, add light, craft tools, and basic food. Text designed for RAG: split into steps, FAQs, and short procedures.

## 0) Essential controls (PC – Java Edition defaults)
- **Move:** W A S D
- **Look:** mouse
- **Jump:** Space
- **Sneak:** Left Shift (hold) → less chance to fall off edges
- **Sprint:** Left Ctrl (hold) or double‑tap W
- **Break block / attack:** Left mouse (hold until the block “breaks”)
- **Use / place / open door / light campfire / interact:** Right mouse
- **Open inventory:** **E**
- **Open the “extra hand” (2×2 crafting) in inventory:** **E** → 2×2 square
- **Switch hotbar item:** mouse wheel (1–9)
- **Drop item:** Q (hold Q to drop multiple)
- **Swap item to off‑hand (if available):** F
- **Open crafting table / furnace / chest:** Right‑click the block

> Tip: Items on the ground enter your inventory when you walk over them. If your inventory is full, items remain on the ground and **may despawn** after a few minutes.

## 1) Start of Day 1 — “fist to the tree” (min 0–5)
1. **Look around and get wood:** walk to a tree log and **hold left click** until it breaks → pick up the **Log**. Repeat until you have **6–10 logs**.
2. **Open inventory (E)** → drag logs to the 2×2 crafting area → **result: Wooden Planks**.
   - Each log becomes **4** planks.
3. **Make a Crafting Table:** place **4 planks** in a 2×2 square → take the **Table**.
4. **Place the Table on the ground:** select it in your hotbar and **right‑click** the ground.
5. **Make Sticks:** in the table or 2×2, put **1 plank above 1 plank** (in a column). You get **4 sticks** per recipe. Make **8–12 sticks**.

> Why hold to break? Blocks need mining time. Bare hands are slow; proper tools are faster.

---

## 2) Wooden tools → stone tools (min 5–12)
1. **Wooden pickaxe (temporary):** at the 3×3 table:
   - Top row: **3 planks**
   - Middle column: **2 sticks** (center and bottom)
   → Make **1 wooden pickaxe**.
2. **Find cobblestone:** look for cliffs/caves. **Never dig straight down.**
3. **Mine 20 cobblestone** with the wooden pickaxe.
4. **Make stone tools (better):**
   - **Stone pickaxe:** 3 stone on top + 2 sticks in the middle column.
   - **Stone axe:** 3 stone in an “L” (two on top, one at middle‑left) + 2 sticks.
   - **Stone shovel:** 1 stone at the top + 2 sticks.
   - **Stone sword (optional):** 2 stone in a column + 1 stick.
5. **Discard or store** the wooden pickaxe (emergency use only).

> Priorities: **axe** (faster wood) and **pickaxe** (for ores).

---

## 3) Quick shelter + light before dark (min 12–20)
- **Watch the sun:** day lasts ~10 min and night ~10 min (total ~20 min). Plan to sleep **before** it gets dark.
- **Instant shelter (any block):**
  - Carve a 2×2×2 hole in a hillside and close with a **door** (6 planks in the table, two columns of 3) **or** block it off leaving a small **window**.
- **Immediate light (charcoal):**
  1. Craft a **Furnace** (8 stone around, empty center).
  2. Put **logs** in the top slot and **any fuel** below (planks, sticks, logs) → produces **Charcoal**.
  3. **Torches:** 1 **charcoal** on top + 1 **stick** below → 4 torches.
- **Light up** the inside and the entrance. Hostile mobs **don’t spawn** on well‑lit blocks.

> Alternative: find **sheep** (3 wool) + **planks** → **Bed**. Sleeping **skips the night** and sets **respawn**.

---

## 4) Hunger, health, and basic food (min 20–35)
- **Bars:** Full hunger → **health regenerates**. Hunger ≤ 6 → no sprint. Hunger 0 → you start taking damage.
- **Easy foods for day 1:**
  - **Apples** from breaking oak leaves (chance).
  - **Raw meat** (cows/pigs/sheep) → **cook** in the furnace (fuel below, meat above).
  - **Bread:** grow **wheat** (slower; better from day 2+).
- **Tips:** always **cook** meat → more hunger and saturation. **Carry 8–12 food** items in your hotbar.

---

## 5) Minimal base organization (min 35–60)
- **Chest:** 8 planks around (empty center). Craft two and place side by side for a **double chest**.
- **Mark home:** place **torches** outside, a **tall pillar** with a torch on top, or a **dirt column** (“back‑home totem”).
- **Replant trees:** use **saplings** from leaves → sustainable wood.
- **Door + pressure plates:** wooden door opens manually. Pressure plates (planks side by side) help, but **zombies can open doors** on higher difficulties (Java hard).

---

## 6) Safe mining (min 60–120)
- **Golden rule:** **never dig straight down**. Use a **staircase** or dig alternating **two‑block** shafts (always standing on one).
- **Torches every 8–12 blocks.**
- **Useful heights:** ores vary by Y‑level. Use the debug screen (F3) to see **Y** (Java).
- **Mining kit:** 1 bucket of **water** (if you have iron), food, extra torches, spare pickaxe, extra wood to craft tools/furnace if needed.
- **Emergency furnace:** you can smelt **iron** (iron ore + fuel) to make a **bucket** (3 iron in a “V”), **shears** (2 iron diagonally), etc.

---

## 7) First goals (checklist)
- [ ] Bed crafted and **respawn point** set.
- [ ] Shelter lit and **chest** organized.
- [ ] Full set of **stone tools**.
- [ ] Furnace + **charcoal** and enough **torches**.
- [ ] 8–12 cooked foods in inventory.
- [ ] Safe mining underway (staircase + torches).

## 8) Frequently Asked Questions (for fast RAG answers)
**How do I get wood if I have nothing?**
Stand by a tree and **hold left click** until it breaks; pick up the log. Turn **logs** into **planks** in your inventory (E).

**How do I place the table?**
Select it in your hotbar and **right‑click** the ground.

**How do I craft torches without coal ore?**
Smelt **logs** in a **furnace** to make **charcoal**. Torch recipe: **1 coal/charcoal + 1 stick**.

**I can’t sprint!**
Your **hunger** is ≤ 6. Eat until it’s higher and you’ll sprint again.

**I keep dying at night.**
Sleep in a **bed** (3 wool + 3 planks) **before** night or stay in a **lit** shelter. Torches **prevent spawns** in the area.

**I lost my base!**
Mark the path with **totems** (block columns) with **a torch** on top and write down coordinates (Java: F3).

**Can I break stone with my fist?**
It takes **forever** and **doesn’t drop** useful blocks. Make at least a **wooden pickaxe**, preferably **stone**.

**What is “saturation”?**
A hidden value that controls how long you stay full. **Better foods** (cooked) give more saturation.

## 9) Micro‑procedures (RAG‑friendly)
**Q: “I need light now and found no coal.”**
**A:** 1) Craft a **furnace** (8 stone) → 2) put **logs** on top and **planks** below → 3) take **charcoal** → 4) craft **torch** (charcoal + stick) → 5) light **inside and outside** the shelter.

**Q: “How do I craft a bed quickly?”**
**A:** 1) Get **3 wool** (kill 3 sheep **or** use **shears** if you have iron) → 2) 3 **planks** on the bottom row + 3 **wool** on the middle row.

**Q: “Quick food?”**
**A:** Kill **pigs/cows/sheep** → cook in the **furnace** with coal/wood. Avoid **raw meat**.

**Q: “How not to get lost?”**
**A:** Build **totems** (block columns) with a **torch** on top at each key turn **and** write down **coordinates**.

## 10) Quick craft (text‑only, no images)
- **Crafting Table:** 4 planks (2×2).
- **Stick:** 1 plank **on top of** 1 plank (column).
- **Furnace:** 8 stone around (empty center).
- **Torch:** 1 coal (or charcoal) on top + 1 stick below.
- **Door:** 6 planks (two columns of 3).
- **Chest:** 8 planks around (empty center).
- **Pickaxe:** 3 hard blocks on top + 2 sticks in the middle column.
- **Axe:** 3 blocks (wood/stone/iron) in an “L” + 2 sticks.

---

## 11) Classic mistakes & how to avoid them
- **Digging straight down** → use a **staircase**.
- **Leaving without food** → always carry **8–12** units.
- **Unlit house** → torches **inside and outside**.
- **Delaying the crafting table** → slows all crafts.
- **Fighting everything at night early on** → **avoid combat**, sleep early.

---

## 12) First 30 minutes script (teleprompter mode for the bot)
- **0–2 min:** gather 6–10 logs.
- **2–4 min:** crafting table, sticks, wooden pickaxe.
- **4–8 min:** mine 20 stone; make stone pickaxe/axe/shovel.
- **8–12 min:** furnace, charcoal, torches.
- **12–18 min:** set up a simple, lit shelter.
- **18–25 min:** hunt 8–12 food and cook.
- **25–30 min:** chest, more torches, plan safe mining.

### End of the initial guide
If you’re comfortable with this, the next step is **iron** (weapons, light armor, bucket, shears) and **safe exploration**.
