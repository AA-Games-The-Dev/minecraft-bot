# Quick Guide to Basic Crafting

The first step in a new world is collecting wood. Punch logs and turn them into planks. From planks you can make a crafting table and sticks — essential for all early recipes.

## Wooden tools

* **Pickaxe:** put three planks in the top row of the 3×3 grid and two sticks in the center column. It’s required to mine stone and unlock better recipes.
* **Axe:** place three planks in an “L” shape in the top‑left, plus two sticks in the center column. Speeds up wood harvesting.
* **Shovel:** one plank at the top of the center column followed by two sticks. Great for dirt, sand, and gravel.
* **Hoe:** two planks in the top row (left & center) and two sticks in the center column. Prepares soil for farming.
* **Sword:** two planks in the center column and a stick in the bottom cell. Boosts melee damage.

## Utility blocks

* **Crafting Table:** four planks in a 2×2 square to unlock the 3×3 grid.
* **Furnace:** eight cobblestone around the grid leaving the center empty. Smelts ores and cooks food.
* **Chest:** eight planks around the 3×3 grid leaving only the center empty. Stores items.

## Lighting & movement

* **Torch:** place coal or charcoal above a stick to craft four torches; they light caves and prevent mobs from spawning.
* **Ladder:** seven sticks in an “H” shape craft ladders for vertical movement.
